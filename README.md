Individual Project #2: Rust CLI Binary with SQLite
Lead Instructor: Alfredo Deza
Requirements:

Your project should include the following:
* Rust source code: The code should comprehensively understand Rust's syntax and unique features.
* Use of GitHub Copilot: In your README, explain how you utilized GitHub Copilot in your coding process.
* SQLite Database: Include a SQLite database and demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
* Optimized Rust Binary: Include a process that generates an optimized Rust binary as a GitHub Actions artifact that can be downloaded.
* README.md: A file that clearly explains what the project does, its dependencies, how to run the program, and how GitHub Copilot was used.
* GitHub Actions: A workflow file that tests, builds, and lints your Rust code.
* Video Demo: A YouTube link in README.md showing a clear, concise walkthrough and demonstration of your CLI binary.
